Example Managerial Insights: 

Comparing the 5 most popular providers (Hulu, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Netflix, and Prime Video), we can see that the  overall average ratings per provider are greatest for Prime Video, as it also has the largest demographic for movies.

Netflix has more TV shows. According to a Business Insider article, Prime Video has the most movies per dollar, with approximately 10,000 movies per dollar spent per month on the membership. However, Netflix still has the higher average, despite being more expensive and having fewer show materials.

--> Therefore, streaming services like Prime Video should focus on implementing more TV shows to keep up with competitors like Netflix. 

### Investment Modeling with R example 

Using Data.rds, Calculate the ey for: tsla, nvda, nio, f, nflx, aapl, msft, amd, dis, pep, ko

As of the beginning of 2017, buy the top 4 ey's into $5000 equal-weighted portfolio

As of the beginning of 2018, buy the bottom 4 ey's into $5000 equally weighted portfolio (use the same ey's from 2017)

Using quantmod, what was the annual compound return of this strategy as of the beginning of 2019?
